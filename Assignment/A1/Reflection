Assignment 1: Set Theory and Function
Assignment 1 introduced me to the foundational concepts of set theory and functions, allowing me to approach problems in a structured manner. 
I gained insights into the relationships between elements and how functions are used to map these relationships, which are crucial for organizing data and solving real-world problems in computer science. 
This assignment strengthened my logical reasoning and understanding of mathematical frameworks.
