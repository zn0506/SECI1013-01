Assignment 3: Discrete Probability Theory and Graph Theory
Assignment 3 was particularly engaging as it combined discrete probability and graph theory. 
Through probability, I learned to quantify uncertainty, a skill that is key to making informed decisions in algorithms and applications. 
Graph theory revealed its vast potential in solving problems related to networks, paths, and relationships, showing how abstract mathematics translates into practical solutions. 
This assignment expanded my understanding of how theory and application merge in computer science.
