This assignment helped me understand trees and finite automata, both essential in computer science. 
Learning tree structures improved my grasp of hierarchical data, while finite automata introduced me to state-based computations.
A key challenge was understanding state transitions in finite automata, but practicing examples helped clarify the concept. 
Implementing tree traversals also improved my problem-solving skills.
Overall, this assignment deepened my understanding and gave me insights into real-world applications.
