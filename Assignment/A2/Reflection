Assignment 2: Recurrence Relations, Counting Method, and Pigeonhole Principle
In Assignment 2, I explored more analytical topics like recurrence relations, which helped me model repetitive problems systematicallyâ€”an essential skill for algorithm analysis. 
The counting methods broadened my perspective on combinatorial problem-solving, while the pigeonhole principle showed how simple logic can address complex scenarios. 
This assignment challenged me to think critically and deepened my appreciation for combinatorial mathematics.
